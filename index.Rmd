# Welcome

This is a completely unofficial test of visualising race results for [TwinTowns Triathlon Club](http://www.twintownstriathlon.org.au).

Results are presented for each race ([Example: December 19](#r-2020-12-19)) and each competitor ([Example](#a-Tracy-Foyster)).

The results on this website are based on publicly available data from the [club's webscorer page](https://www.webscorer.com/33755) and some guesses (for now) in places where the webscorer data appears inaccurate (e.g. split times unrealistic or missing). This is still a work-in-progress, let me know if I've guessed something wrong.
