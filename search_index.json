[["index.html", "TwinTowns Triathlon Club Race Times Welcome", " TwinTowns Triathlon Club Race Times Josh Horsley Updated: 2020-12-28 15:36 AEDT Welcome This is a completely unofficial test of visualising race results for TwinTowns Triathlon Club. Results are presented for each race (Example: December 19) and each competitor (Example). The results on this website are based on publicly available data from the club’s webscorer page and some guesses (for now) in places where the webscorer data appears inaccurate (e.g. split times unrealistic or missing).
